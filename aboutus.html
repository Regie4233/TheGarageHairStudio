                    I founded The Garage Hair Studio in 2013 with a vision to create a professional, comfortable space
                    for men to get
                    their haircut. <br> I started in the industry 27yrs ago. My training began in a unisex salon and I
                    quickly knew that I enjoyed doing short haircuts for both men and women. <br> I excel in scissor and
                    razor cuts, as well as clipper cuts. Other than taking haircutting advanced classes over the years,
                    I have also studied color theory and technique. <br> If you can’t find me in the shop then I am sure
                    to
                    be hanging with my fury brood of 2 dogs and 2 cats, as I am an avid animal lover.</p>

                    I have been doing hair for about three years and I specialize in both men's and women’s services. I
                    offer haircuts, coloring, and also eyelash extension services! I decided to get into this industry
                    because I love working with people and being creative. Aside from cosmetology, I love to paint and
                    play around with special effects makeup.
